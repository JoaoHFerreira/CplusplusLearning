# C++ Learning Repository Structure
This repository is organized into three distinct sections:

---

## 1. Foundational Projects:
### Elementary Command Line Calculator
By employing fundamental C++ concepts such as variables, functions, loops, and more, I will construct a straightforward command-line calculator capable of executing fundamental arithmetic operations.
### File Management Utility
Leveraging C++ file handling principles, I will design a basic file management tool empowered to conduct essential file operations, including file creation, deletion, renaming, and more.
